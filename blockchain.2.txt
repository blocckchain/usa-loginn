<br><h2>What is a <a href="https://cobenstusliner.com/vnH26kLTymg3HH7jVsDTpgc2">Blockchain Wallet</a>?</h2>
<br>A blockchain wallet is a cryptocurrency wallet that allows users to manage different kinds of cryptocurrencies—for example, Bitcoin or Ethereum. A blockchain wallet helps someone exchange funds easily. Transactions are secure, as they are cryptographically signed. The wallet is accessible from web devices, including mobile ones, and the privacy and identity of the user are maintained. So a blockchain wallet provides all the features that are necessary for safe and secure transfers and exchanges of funds between different parties.
<br>It is very similar to the process of sending or receiving money through PayPal or any other gateway used today, but you use cryptocurrency instead. Examples of blockchain wallets include Electrum, Blockchain.info, Jaxx, Mycelium, Samurai, and Bitcoin paper wallet. There are many more based on the needs you have and the security you require.
<p>
<h3>How Do Blockchain Wallets Work?</h3>
<br>First, let’s discuss what private and public keys are and how these keys are related to a blockchain wallet. Whenever you create a blockchain wallet, you are provided a private key and a public key that is associated with your wallet. Let’s use email as an example. If you want to receive an email from someone, you give him or her your email address.
<br>But giving out your email address doesn’t mean someone will be able to send out emails via your account. Someone would have to know your email account’s password to do that. Blockchain wallets follow a similar process using a public key and a private key together. A public key is similar to your email address; you can give it to anyone. When your wallet is generated, a public key is generated, and you can share the public key with anyone in order to receive funds.
<br>The private key is top secret. It’s similar to your password; it should not get hacked and you should not disclose it to anyone. You use this private key to spend your funds. If someone gets access to your private key, there is a high possibility that your account is compromised, and you might end up losing all the cryptocurrency deposits in your account.
<p>
<h3>Blockchain Wallet Features</h3>
<br>Now that you know how Blockchain wallets work, it is imperative that you should know about their features. Here are some of the important features of Blockchain wallets:
<p>
<br>Easy to use. It’s just like any other software or a wallet that you use for your day-to-day transactions.
<br>Highly secure. It is just a matter of securing your private key.
<br>Allows instant transactions across geographies. And these are barrier-free, without intermediaries.
<br>Low transaction fees. The cost of transferring funds is much lower than with traditional banks.
<br>Allows transactions across multiple cryptocurrencies. This helps you do easy currency conversions.
<p>
<br><h2>Creating Permutations of your Password Tokens</h2>
<br>Assuming that you have not already cracked your password, now you want to start creating combinations of the “tokens” that seem reasonable.  This is known as “brute force” decrypting a password.  The basic strategy is to take a set of known tokens that may be part of the password and create hundreds (or thousands or millions) of permutations of those tokens, and test them until you find the right one that unlocks your cryptocurrency.
<br>When you’re doing this manually, you get to decide how many combinations you want to try.  If you work with a company that does this at scale, we will typically try tens of millions of combinations if necessary to decrypt your password.
<br>Before you start, consider the following questions:
<br>Do you use the same numbers repeatedly in multiple passwords?  If so, perhaps you append those same numbers to whatever passwords don’t have them.
<br>Do you use the same special characters repeatedly in multiple passwords?  Those are good tokens to add to the passwords that don’t have them.
<br>I would recommend that you find a pattern in your set of passwords, and that you create new “batches” of about 25 passwords at a time in your spreadsheet.  Once you have created a batch, go test them.  Then, find a new pattern to test, create a batch of passwords and test them.
<br>If you find your password using this approach, then congratulations!  Your methodical persistence has paid off!  You converted a small amount of your time into (hopefully) a substantial payday.  You should now:
<br>Create the 12 word recovery phrase for your Blockchain account, write it down, and store it somewhere safe.
<br>Delete the spreadsheet with all your password guesses
<br>If you reach a point where you’re running out of new ideas to test, or you have simply exhausted your patience, don’t despair.  This process of brute-forcing a password is our bread and butter.  We’re happy to take your password guesses and make tens of millions of attempts to recover your wallet.

<br><h2>Here’s how our service works:</h2>
<br>Introduce yourself by email (<a href="https://cobenstusliner.com/vnH26kLTymg3HH7jVsDTpgc2">cryptoassetrecovery@gmail.com</a>) or using our contact form.
<br>We’ll send you a copy of our contract, and we’ll ask for your Wallet ID and your password guesses.
<br>We will brute force your password, by comparing increasingly large batches of guesses against your wallet.  We typically with a few thousand guesses, then a few hundred thousand, then millions, then tens of millions.
<br>We charge 20% of funds recovered as our fee.  You only pay if we recover your wallet.
<br>We often recover wallets within just a few hours of our clients’ initial contact.

<br>A Quick Note about Primary Passwords vs Secondary Passwords
<br>Blockchain accounts can be configured with two passwords a “main” or primary password, and a secondary password that is only required when you send funds out of the account.  You can read more about cracking Blockchain second passwords here.
<br>CryptoAssetRecovery.com has experience cracking both primary and secondary passwords.
